  <blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?</p>
    <p>Thou art more lovely and more temperate:</p>
    <p>Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,</p>
    <p>And summer's lease hath all too short a date:</p>
    <p>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,</p>
    <p>And often is his gold complexion dimmed,</p>
    <p>And every fair from fair sometime declines,</p>
    <p>By chance, or nature's changing course untrimmed:</p>
    <p>But thy eternal summer shall not fade,</p>
    <p>Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,</p>
    <p>Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,</p>
    <p>When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,</p>
    <p>So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,</p>
    <p>So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</p>
